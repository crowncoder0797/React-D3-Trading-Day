Great things about this UI is that:
1) No page refresh (everything async)
2) algolia-instant-search component is pretty spiffy
3) a visually stunning configuration of react-stock-chart's heikin-ashi candle-stick-charts
    - lets not forget about a stylized candlestick rescued from vx/demo. 
4) It embraces skeumorphic design principles to render analog styled UI

Did I mention,
it has a d3's force-layout executed with carefree ease and abandon of react-hooks, context.
